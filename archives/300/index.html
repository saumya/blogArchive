		<p>Everytime I visit Bhubaneswar, I get inspiried by my fellow friends here. These guys are really changed the face of architecture in the city and in the state of Orissa. The conventional way, the conventional thinking and the conventional excution are just history now. <a href="http://saumyaray.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/new-kind-of-offices/">As of my past visit to the place, and my thoughts regarding that is already in here</a>. I am not repeating them, rather putting something else here.<br />
There are so many new architectural firms and they all are doing good.They are doing so good that, some of these successful enterpreneurs are starting their second venture. Wow! thats so awesome to know. Well, these guys are changing everything. Where convention told us that one should not be a friend to the collegue, these new breed enterpreneurs are growing as a community and thats a very big news.Previously community was a fake thing to showoff each other, now its for the purpose of betterment of each and everyone.<br />
The life style, is simple and on the move always.That does not mean busy for nothing, rather these people are really active in community events and take resposibility on orgsanising community events too. This is very unlike as conventaional thoughts here are very deep rooted and always tells not to waste time in these kind of things rather spend time in your own office. But these people are taking things to the upper level, they know how much commmunity is a necessity for growing our own self. Last time I had a talk with one of my friends, who is in a very high post and is serving to one of the bigger software companies in India and is abroad for a long long time. He asked me, &#8220;whether these guys have projects?!&#8221; For him, like a lot of other software people (managers, delivery heads, account mangers etc) being busy in office doing nothing is called good work. Now I must say, these people here have got such a lot of work that its even beyound the visible area of most you high ranked fellows in a software company. That does not mean, you leave your life and be in the office 7 days and 24 hours. And thats exactly what guys here are doing. Enjoying their life and doing their job to earn money. This is not same as earn money to live the life rather living life and earning money.<br />
These guys took the chance and made it big, and now on their second venture, they are joining forces to go even bigger. Congratulations guys and best wishes for your new venture.<br />
In the evening, I enjoy their company at the badminton court, despite from different offices, different profiles, these are just friends outside. They help, share and grow. Thats life. They have just rejected to just exist and make the life a beautiful living.<br />
The tough part and most ignored one is the hard work, patience and the risk they had taken ten years back. Yes, as it is said, your success is kind of misunderstood as a overnight success which had taken 10 years of hard work. Exactly the samething is in play here. All the risk, hardwork and new thoughts are now seen as success and only success.<br />
All the best to you all for your work and aspirations. Thank you all for giving me such a motivation to keep on working and keep on growing. And the most important thing is believing in yourself. That one thing has changed everyone including people here. Despite of the conventional forces, the believe, that there is a better way to do things, is a nice thing to learn from these new breed enterpreneures.</p>
<p>I will be collecting some photos of the work and fun here and keep it for a later post. Would love to see your reactions and comments here.</p>
