			<p>Happy new year 2014.</p>
<p>Wishing all you a very happy, healthy and prosperous new year.</p>
<p>Its one of those times, when one looks back before moving towards future.<br />
Well 2013,the year that was.</p>
<p>It started with shifting gears officially for me. Working partly with Javascript for a long time now, but this time its official and officially I started working on Javascript projects in my current organisation. So a full year of Javascript and everything Javascript. Yeah, a lot ground covered. So the Javascript based, Phonegap (cordova) was for me in the beginning, officially for a project for iOS and finally got approved and available in AppStore. There was a time when Phonegap based plugin for Push Notification did not work on iOS, so updated the Phonegap Push Notification Plugin for iOS and push it to Github. And to my surprise, people actually forked it and made it better ! Awesome experience to give back, learn and grow.<br />
On my personal work, added my phonegap based Mobile projects in GooglePlay store for Android.</p>
<p>Apart from mobile and Phonegap, for browser based application, I used NodeJS, MongoDB and BackboneJS. Learnt how to host in Heroku and Github for NodeJS based applications. Well, on serverside frameworks, I picked up Express for NodeJS and an application is pushed to Heroku.</p>
<p>At one point, I was evaluating Dart-lang, CoffeeScript and TypeScript for projects. So a lot of learning there and made simple projects with Dart-lang. Its a sweet language, I must say.</p>
<p>On BDD, I used Jasmine for my application. For build process, I started using GruntJS. The complete Javascript based environments kept me busy learning and at the same time gave me a lot of happiness and excitement in doing so.</p>
<p>On later part of the year 2013, I was mentoring a fellow developer in iOS for a native ObjectiveC based iOS project. I am so happy to see his progress and that made me confident that I can do more than just doing ObjectiveC projects.</p>
<p>Personally, I was working on HAXE and LIME (OpenFL) all through out the year. That made me push my app to Tizen AppStore appart from iOS AppStore and Google PlayStore. It is such a nice experience to make cross-platform development fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://saumya.github.io/">I put together all my project links at one page to refer.</a></p>
<p>2013 was another eventful year for me, I got the sweet gift of my life. Me and wife are blessed with a baby boy &#8220;Dibyamshu&#8221;.</p>
<p>So this year, 2014 starts with a bang. While all these technologies maturing and me having real experience on these, it feels a lot is possible. On the other side, I really hope that 2014 would be the beginning of the playful years to come, making me busy with Dibyamshu.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

			<p>I was thinking to write this post for past some months, but anyway, today I made sure to put it down.<br />
In this busy world, when I decided to get married, I was not sure how it will al end up. Now after one year, I must say, from the beginning only my beloved wife made sure that the experience I get out of life, must be filled with life. I could not thank her for all the experiences we had together through the year.<br />
When we left home to come to my work place (which are two different towns far enough), she made me confident that everything will out, though she was coming out for the first time.<br />
I could not stop thinking the horrible driver and his horrifying driving on our way back from Goa. It was as if we(me and my beloved wife) were kidnapped. We started around 10AM in the morning. The driver never stopped, even if we told him several times. But when he stopped, it was midnight and at the middle of a hill. It was raining heavily and dark everywhere. The forest was dense, and the driver stopped the car. Then the driver went ahead to meet some of his friends, leaving us sitting in the car. There were no phone networks at that place. Fortunately we returned with the same driver and reached around 3AM in the next day morning. I could see deep fear in the eyes of my wife but then she made it clear that we are going to make it. And that belief made me less panic. This was just after somedays of locating in the town of my workplace.<br />
Not very long after, when my mother was in bed counting her last breath, it was my wife, who insisted on going back alone, to home own and take care of her mother in-law. Finally, when my mom died and the rituals were done, I was surprised to see my wife, taking everything on her shoulders and doing it with absolute interest.<br />
Theses just some incidents out of the happening last year. Apart from the all these there were so many things happening everyday that I almost fall in love with the learning to look at life from a different perspective.<br />
I could not have continued doing the things I love, without her support and encouragement. Food was always ready and it is almost always delicious. And now, I just do not want to have outside food.It reminds of my mom and grand mom, everytime I eat food cooked by my beloved wife.<br />
The most notable and important thing that she taught me by here actions and thoughts is, life is now or never. I was almost in a path of counting numbers, but she gave me back the life I was missing. I learned to love the small things, which absolutely give life to our lives. Smiling and being happy always is just here nature and I hope I will catch up to her someday.<br />
I would say, it was not easy but the experience is priceless.<br />
There are lot, but would conclude the post here saying, &#8220;Thank you for being there and giving me the year long priceless experience. I love you and happy anniversary&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Happy new year and its already started. As you can see the post is a little late, for the year is started for me, in a busy mode, which is always a positive sign.<br />
<a href="http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bg.jpg"><img src="http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bg-1024x767.jpg" alt="" title="bg" width="584" height="437" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1064" /></a><br />
Time for a retrospect of the last year. The year 2012 was a very happening year for me after my college days.<br />
1. I got into a startup in Jan 2012 ( pixykids and now renamed to Kazaana )<br />
2. Met a friend and her family from Swizerland ( <a href="http://twitter.com/stephtara">Stephanie Booth</a> <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/">http://climbtothestars.org/</a> )<br />
3. Attended first Tweet-meetup for Pune in Pune<br />
4. Took interviews for senior flex developer from all around India for the start-up I joined<br />
5. A lot of learning and research and development happened for multi-user application development. Finally demoed and implemented <a href="http://unionplatform.com/">Union Platform</a> for the product I was working on the start-up.<br />
6. Got Married.<br />
7. Looking the product I was working on being released in staging server, alpha version and public beta.<br />
8. And finally towards the end of the year, I lost my mom, may her soul rest in peace.</p>
<p>So the eventful year of highs and lows came to an end and given a chance to look at things in new perspective.</p>

			<p>A very happy new year to all of you.</p>
<p>As you can see I am posting this late, its not intentional but the new year really brought on a lot of energy, surprises and happenings with it from day one. While the year 2011 ended with a big surprise as, meeting a long time online friend <a href="http://climbtothestars.org" target="_blank">Stephanie</a> along with her parents in person. The new year started with a travel to other part of the country and back. My first flight of the year is on the 1st morning. The travel started right in the very early morning. Where there is generally no chance of getting a rickshaw to the airport, I got it right across the lonely road in the middle of the night, a welcoming new year gesture of 2012 I hope. Then the very next day, got some pending money back from my old employer! ahh, nothing like it. Met some old friends and spent quite a quality time. All in all it is a good beginning. Hope it will go on like this for me and for you all.</p>
<p>Cut down the negativity and move on with all your positive spirits, things are bound to happen.</p>
<p>With that wishing you all a very happy and prosperous new year ahead.</p>

			<p><em>(language: Odiya) Khanda pralaya ru khanda pralaya parjyanta : (language : Hindi)Quayamat se Quayamat tak&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>Long long ago, there were 5 lions staying in a jungle with their families. A 5000 strong grazing animal population was part of the food chain and there was no problem for sustainability. Lions were on hunting spree when they were hungry; else they were uncles to everybody. Climate was good, no dearth of grass, enough water in the river, many fruits in the trees with lot of monkeys of course!! One day a little bird said to one uncle Lion that two strange animals are coming towards their jungle. They walk on their rear limbs, have no tails, eat anything eatable, stay inside a self-made nest, and use tools to do simple things to very complicated things. They have killed many animals on their way including an elephant by using their strange tools. They use some vocals to communicate. They preserve food for bad weather and use a rolling cart for transportations. I think they are dangerous. They are coming to stay here….for ever. The lion said, “I am the king of this jungle. Don’t you know which protein I eat? Elephant is a weak grass eating animal. Let them come I`ll pounce those walky talkies. I am very cruel when I am hungry. Everybody knows. They are not coming to my jungle but to my empty stomach”.</p>
<p>The lion waited and waited, they didn`t turn up. After few days he became very hungry. He thought those guys ran away to some other place. He saw a big fat immobilized spotted deer and thought for a great dinner instead. It was a trap. The two walky talkies killed him. Similarly they killed all the lions and started living there. With time their population grew. There were no lions, so they were on the top of the food chain. They developed medicines from herbs, used fire for cooking and many new things which surprized other animals. They overwhelmingly killed the grazing animals, even if they were not hungry! After few hundred years, grazing animals reduced to double digits. So they cleaned up jungle for agriculture, domesticated the leftover animals. After few hundred years they required more land for agriculture. A fraction of them migrated to the other side of the river and applied all the techniques they knew from this side of the river. After few hundred years, they started looking differently across the river. After few hundred years they had their own vocal communications, customs and Gods somewhat similar and somewhat different. Each side of the river started treating them as a better species. After few hundred years their number became huge. No more jungle no more grass land remained except the desert. At that point of time, they had two options either to reduce their consumption or to produce more. But they could do neither because they were habituated to live in an expensive way and their resources were limited. So they started begging, then stealing, then robbing each other. But none of them worked. So each side across the river secretly decided to attack the other side. They secretly build up unique war-fares and thought that they had an edge. One stormy night, the war started. All the weapons used. Rest is history.</p>
<p>Somebody said, “We all are born to consume resources”. Consume responsibly to live bit longer.</p>

			<p>After a small travel around the country, meeting old friends, making new friends, visiting old places, going to new places and what not, finally I am back home. So the delay and posting here. Though travelling could not hold me back from posting, but then I took some time off to be back again and posting here.<br />
By the way, thank you all who are visiting it, I must say the amount of crowd I am getting here is really motivating. Please do leave a comment, they are equally valuable to me too <img src='http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
