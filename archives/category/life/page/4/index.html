			<p>Everytime I visit Bhubaneswar, I get inspiried by my fellow friends here. These guys are really changed the face of architecture in the city and in the state of Orissa. The conventional way, the conventional thinking and the conventional excution are just history now. <a href="http://saumyaray.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/new-kind-of-offices/">As of my past visit to the place, and my thoughts regarding that is already in here</a>. I am not repeating them, rather putting something else here.<br />
There are so many new architectural firms and they all are doing good.They are doing so good that, some of these successful enterpreneurs are starting their second venture. Wow! thats so awesome to know. Well, these guys are changing everything. Where convention told us that one should not be a friend to the collegue, these new breed enterpreneurs are growing as a community and thats a very big news.Previously community was a fake thing to showoff each other, now its for the purpose of betterment of each and everyone.<br />
The life style, is simple and on the move always.That does not mean busy for nothing, rather these people are really active in community events and take resposibility on orgsanising community events too. This is very unlike as conventaional thoughts here are very deep rooted and always tells not to waste time in these kind of things rather spend time in your own office. But these people are taking things to the upper level, they know how much commmunity is a necessity for growing our own self. Last time I had a talk with one of my friends, who is in a very high post and is serving to one of the bigger software companies in India and is abroad for a long long time. He asked me, &#8220;whether these guys have projects?!&#8221; For him, like a lot of other software people (managers, delivery heads, account mangers etc) being busy in office doing nothing is called good work. Now I must say, these people here have got such a lot of work that its even beyound the visible area of most you high ranked fellows in a software company. That does not mean, you leave your life and be in the office 7 days and 24 hours. And thats exactly what guys here are doing. Enjoying their life and doing their job to earn money. This is not same as earn money to live the life rather living life and earning money.<br />
These guys took the chance and made it big, and now on their second venture, they are joining forces to go even bigger. Congratulations guys and best wishes for your new venture.<br />
In the evening, I enjoy their company at the badminton court, despite from different offices, different profiles, these are just friends outside. They help, share and grow. Thats life. They have just rejected to just exist and make the life a beautiful living.<br />
The tough part and most ignored one is the hard work, patience and the risk they had taken ten years back. Yes, as it is said, your success is kind of misunderstood as a overnight success which had taken 10 years of hard work. Exactly the samething is in play here. All the risk, hardwork and new thoughts are now seen as success and only success.<br />
All the best to you all for your work and aspirations. Thank you all for giving me such a motivation to keep on working and keep on growing. And the most important thing is believing in yourself. That one thing has changed everyone including people here. Despite of the conventional forces, the believe, that there is a better way to do things, is a nice thing to learn from these new breed enterpreneures.</p>
<p>I will be collecting some photos of the work and fun here and keep it for a later post. Would love to see your reactions and comments here.</p>

			<p>If you can say that I know someone, its just a false statement, unless the person also agrees.  And everyone has got that gift to really know people around. But in the midst of the crowd, and in our busy schedule, we generally forget to look at it. Then we know that we do not know even the next person who sits by your side in the office, but publicly we have to say that we know each and everyone very well. That increases our chance to be a social animal. But then, that increases the insecurity. Once you are in a false path, it leads to another and the process continues. And in the end, its regret inside and all happy outside. Do you want to die a life of regret?! Do not answer to anyone, but just ask yourself.</p>
<p>All of us are blessed with precious gifts such as love, faith, believe, friends, relations and what not. But we tend to focus on bad and ugly part of life. Why ?! For it comes to us and we think we do not have to do anything, it just happened to us.  In the contrary, the truth is, even if you want to be normal, you have to fight against the odd. Its like standing in a flowing river. If you just have to stand still, you have to make an effort for that. Else, you know, you will be flowing in the direction the water is flowing. The same holds good for the life as well. There are wrong and toxic forces all around. If you just be yourself, then without your knowledge, you will be flowing in the wrong direction. So to be your own self, you have to make an effort. Forget about getting better, that even requires more effort.</p>
<p>Well, I was talking about knowing a person. It is a beautiful feeling to know people from inside, what they are thinking, how they are leading life. And that comes when you listen to them. It takes time but when you make it, its a pleasant feeling that only those can understand who ever have believed in a stranger and made that relation for the life. Sometimes the experience hurts, but at-least you know you are exposed to truth. For people around you see are not the same from inside. There are so many examples I have seen in my life till date, who from a distance looks well and good, but when you see inside they are in complete pain, struggling with their own fight with life. But still they never convey negative energy to anyone. They got hurt by the people who are evil and insecure but still they are by themselves challenged the life to remain truthful to themselves.</p>
<p>Its only possible know them if you nurture your gift of knowing people. and its not hard, its just that you must have will to do it. Some people I know were in jail for quite sometime in life and now leading a happy family. You never got to know them by face or profession. But they fought back with life and back in it again.</p>
<p>There are persons, who were suffering so much in life that they just want to break free and go somewhere else. But its not that they do not have courage to do that. Its the opposite. They have more courage than they have, so they are fighting the situation out from the place they are, rather leaving it halfway.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are people who just do not seem to be active in any situation. But when you get into the inside of them they are more colourful and lively than you ever have thought of.</p>
<p>Knowing people is a gift to given to everyone, and if you really like to know a person then just spend sometime with them with your heart open to experience the life. Life has so much more than it just looks to our eyes.</p>
<p>Happy living</p>

			<p>This was just in the books until now, but I began to realise its not books only. Its the universe, and its awesome, beautiful power.  This is not about wealth but peace and happiness. Some people just do it for money in the shake of logic ( That also their own made ). I was always tried to understand them and always thought they may be have a point. But the truth is beginning to unfold in front of me. Its the power, the thought and how we use it. There is really nothing which is impossible but you must see it all the time. Day dreaming is bad, but dreaming is the first step towards doing something. So dream, whatever you think you should be doing. And the world will help you make your believe come true. And yes, intentions must be kept clear, for The God is not upto your logics and the same goes for this beautiful universe.<br />
The thoughts of yours go into the world, if they are evil, it will come back to you only. Sooner or later, the truth always wins.<br />
Never ever try to build up a relationship, any relationship with false hood. Whether its hobby, job or personal, be true to yourself and everything will fall in place. If you are thinking positive, those thoughts also will comeback to you. So keep dreaming and dream positive and infinite. The key to get there is actually within, one just need to believe.<br />
Until now, I was never able to say all this. For I was all the time have doubts for me. But at-least I can say, today I am feeling I am moving in right direction and feeling much confident about me. So sharing my thoughts, just be yourself and listen to your heart. I know, there are toxic people around, try and avoid them at all possible circumstances, for they are the evil to the core and just 5 mins of your time with them may require your 5 days to get back to your own self. They are toxic than poisonous snakes and evil creatures.  But sometimes you need to be there, for without them you might not appreciate the real good of life. So the point is, their poison destroys them, and thats bound to happen. For everything that goes out comes back. These people are never happy, always worried and insecure. They will play all the evil games, but never concentrate or loose your focus. For what they are, they will be like that and die like that. Just think, do you really want to be like that? You are born free and infinite, concentrate and move on. Life is waiting for you. Do not die every minute, but live now.<br />
And most importantly, think positive, infinite and abundance. That will comeback to you. Share love and affection and friendliness and genuine. That will comeback to you. If you think, you can make it, then go try for it. I am sure you can make it. If you fail, then you learn. Try again, if you fail again, you learn something more, try again and never give up.</p>
