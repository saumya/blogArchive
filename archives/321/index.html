		<p>Well, its a long time since I have done anything, I used to do for a long long time. I am getting back to the normal flow of life again. This was a break I needed and I am very satisfied with my move.<br />
There was a time, not so long back when I got surrounded by such negative people for a long time,  that I had to cut it at any cost. The worst part is, when you are going in a negative stream, you always feel good and think you are with right kind people. But actually its all decisive and the truth is as it is said, &#8220;if you are not facing any difficulty in a day, you are not moving forward&#8221;. I had to do some drastic changes in order to get back to track.<br />
I am happy that my actions not only get me back on track but revealed some really unknown facts of life which I could not have experienced otherwise, as its said, even the darkest cloud has a silver lining. My suggestion would be try and avoid negativity in any form and be true to yourself. The world and life will unfold some beautiful new things everyday making the journey an exciting one.<br />
On my way back to the track, I was not all confident all the time, but hope was there to get in place. It was not smooth but that is interesting in itself. I got some real nice invitations from different companies and associations to get into a job. I had options in hand and different options gave me different dimensions to the vision. Exciting <img src='http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  yeah, it is. Finally I have joined a mid sized company with a standard salary, when I had offer in hand, which were almost double in the salary structure and much above on corporate ladder. I never felt so confident to deny big corporate names and bigger positions in them. I am happy and confident and I know what I am doing. So satisfying.<br />
In the mean time, i started visiting places and finally changed my location too. Exciting again . Meeting new people, seeing new culture and most importantly enjoying them all again.<br />
I am so glad to be back again. Love you all, those, who stand by me and encourage me during my these past days.<br />
So finally landed on foot after jumping from the cliff. The free fall was exciting.<br />
Happy living <img src='http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
