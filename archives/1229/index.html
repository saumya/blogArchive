		<p>I was thinking to write this post for past some months, but anyway, today I made sure to put it down.<br />
In this busy world, when I decided to get married, I was not sure how it will al end up. Now after one year, I must say, from the beginning only my beloved wife made sure that the experience I get out of life, must be filled with life. I could not thank her for all the experiences we had together through the year.<br />
When we left home to come to my work place (which are two different towns far enough), she made me confident that everything will out, though she was coming out for the first time.<br />
I could not stop thinking the horrible driver and his horrifying driving on our way back from Goa. It was as if we(me and my beloved wife) were kidnapped. We started around 10AM in the morning. The driver never stopped, even if we told him several times. But when he stopped, it was midnight and at the middle of a hill. It was raining heavily and dark everywhere. The forest was dense, and the driver stopped the car. Then the driver went ahead to meet some of his friends, leaving us sitting in the car. There were no phone networks at that place. Fortunately we returned with the same driver and reached around 3AM in the next day morning. I could see deep fear in the eyes of my wife but then she made it clear that we are going to make it. And that belief made me less panic. This was just after somedays of locating in the town of my workplace.<br />
Not very long after, when my mother was in bed counting her last breath, it was my wife, who insisted on going back alone, to home own and take care of her mother in-law. Finally, when my mom died and the rituals were done, I was surprised to see my wife, taking everything on her shoulders and doing it with absolute interest.<br />
Theses just some incidents out of the happening last year. Apart from the all these there were so many things happening everyday that I almost fall in love with the learning to look at life from a different perspective.<br />
I could not have continued doing the things I love, without her support and encouragement. Food was always ready and it is almost always delicious. And now, I just do not want to have outside food.It reminds of my mom and grand mom, everytime I eat food cooked by my beloved wife.<br />
The most notable and important thing that she taught me by here actions and thoughts is, life is now or never. I was almost in a path of counting numbers, but she gave me back the life I was missing. I learned to love the small things, which absolutely give life to our lives. Smiling and being happy always is just here nature and I hope I will catch up to her someday.<br />
I would say, it was not easy but the experience is priceless.<br />
There are lot, but would conclude the post here saying, &#8220;Thank you for being there and giving me the year long priceless experience. I love you and happy anniversary&#8221;.</p>
