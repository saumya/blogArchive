Last weekend I am fortunate to visit Coorg, a hill station near Bangalore. I must say, it was a beautiful experience. A must visit for anyone who loves nature. There is a beautiful waterfall, a place you should not miss. Just sheer nature and its love, one can only feel.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saumyaray/5958601958/" title="waterfall by saumyaray, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6140/5958601958_35bcb04f96.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="waterfall"></a><br />

There are natural cottages made for staying back. And the good thing is electric power is only available for 2 hours in night. Thats pretty awesome. As it was cold outside and almost all the time raining, one does not need electricity at all. There are these little candle lights and the night just seemed more enjoyable.<br />

Well, this place seemed part of a wildlife sanctuary, so on our way we happened to see some wild animals as bear and deer.<br />
We did a small trekking around the hill and must say it was an exciting experience as there were leeches on the path, the whole path was filled with leeches. And one is bound to get the leeches, so the best part is how to deal with problem when we have to go with it. That was the learning of the life time. And you know what? Leeches are not dangerous at all, people in that area are habituated with it. So the advice we got is, take a lemon with you all the time. Once you get a leech on your body, put the lemon juice into it. Do not panic and scratch the leech, as one can not get that thing out with hand. Well the most interesting part is when leeches suck your blood, you do not feel any pain!! They will come to your body, suck your blood up and go away as soon as they are full, and sometimes they burst also after drinking too much of blood, LOL <img src='http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saumyaray/5958139749/" title="trekking with Leeches by saumyaray, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/5958139749_670c52ce4c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="trekking with Leeches"></a><br />
The most important part is, one is bound to get the leeches on one&#8217;s body, so the choice is whether to go on the trek or not? That is the lesson to learn. Fun and excitement comes and brings some sort of frightening moment but if you do not panic, just enjoy the moment and go with the flow without trying to control it, you will feel the full potential of nature and as such life also <img src='http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  All of us got some leeches on our body too <img src='http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I got frightened once I saw one leech was just getting into my shoes!! It felt very frightening to me for once, tried removing it from outside, but as I said you can not remove it with your hand. Do not panic, remove your shoes, put some lemon juice and there you go. And one more thing, if at all you find one leech on your body, the damage is already done to you, the amount of blood it needs is already sucked!! So no point panic. I was carrying 3 more leeches with me, until I reach the base camp, where I found they are still with me travelled all the distance from the mountain.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saumyaray/5958591738/" title="water rafting by saumyaray, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6148/5958591738_341df257e8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="water rafting"></a><br />
Then came the first time in my life, water rafting. It was just as awesome as the wind, rain and wild water in this high force mountain river.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saumyaray/5958033323/" title="water rafting by saumyaray, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6021/5958033323_82b8f26f18.jpg" width="500" height="447" alt="water rafting"></a><br />
Must say, I got a fantastic team with with. All of us were almost for the first time but almost all of us were ready to make it. The most interesting part is all most all of us are either do not know swimming or just do swimming pool swim. Looking at the river, the flowing water and its speed make us all nervous but then we had already decided to make it. Thanks to the wonderful guide in our boat, he was encouraging us all the time. Once we got stuck in the bushes somehow, it seemed a tough job to get back to the flowing water. For it was very tough to push the boat inside water, against water. We kept our cool and enjoyed the beauty of nature. That experience was just mind blowing. Two other guides came to rescue and we were back on the flowing water. Rest was just enjoying the flow and speed of water, the turbulence and water hitting all our faces, water coming inside boat and we kept moving with the constant instructions of the guide. Finally all of us reached safe and made an amazing experience.<br />

I would say, must try, yaaaaaaaahhoooo. </p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Saumya, this is a MAGNIFICENT post. I LOVE it. So beautiful. So alive. I am so glad that you shared this and that I caught it in the thread. Your photos and video and stunning. And I laughed about the leeches. Yes, I got them on me when I lived in the Australian rainforest.</p>
<p>I have taken a big raft like this through water, I was the one at the oars. But then I grew up on a lake and did a lot of boating. So you guys were all so VERY brave and live with adventurous spirits. Definitely: &#8220;yaaaaaaaahhoooo&#8221; .</p>
<p>I would love to someday see this part of the world. And I am so proud of you for taking this wild trip into nature and the river, Saumya. You are an life long ADVENTURER!! Good for you!! <img src='http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  <img src='http://saumya.github.io/blogArchive/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   Thank you for taking the time to share it.
