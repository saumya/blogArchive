		<p>If you can say that I know someone, its just a false statement, unless the person also agrees.  And everyone has got that gift to really know people around. But in the midst of the crowd, and in our busy schedule, we generally forget to look at it. Then we know that we do not know even the next person who sits by your side in the office, but publicly we have to say that we know each and everyone very well. That increases our chance to be a social animal. But then, that increases the insecurity. Once you are in a false path, it leads to another and the process continues. And in the end, its regret inside and all happy outside. Do you want to die a life of regret?! Do not answer to anyone, but just ask yourself.</p>
<p>All of us are blessed with precious gifts such as love, faith, believe, friends, relations and what not. But we tend to focus on bad and ugly part of life. Why ?! For it comes to us and we think we do not have to do anything, it just happened to us.  In the contrary, the truth is, even if you want to be normal, you have to fight against the odd. Its like standing in a flowing river. If you just have to stand still, you have to make an effort for that. Else, you know, you will be flowing in the direction the water is flowing. The same holds good for the life as well. There are wrong and toxic forces all around. If you just be yourself, then without your knowledge, you will be flowing in the wrong direction. So to be your own self, you have to make an effort. Forget about getting better, that even requires more effort.</p>
<p>Well, I was talking about knowing a person. It is a beautiful feeling to know people from inside, what they are thinking, how they are leading life. And that comes when you listen to them. It takes time but when you make it, its a pleasant feeling that only those can understand who ever have believed in a stranger and made that relation for the life. Sometimes the experience hurts, but at-least you know you are exposed to truth. For people around you see are not the same from inside. There are so many examples I have seen in my life till date, who from a distance looks well and good, but when you see inside they are in complete pain, struggling with their own fight with life. But still they never convey negative energy to anyone. They got hurt by the people who are evil and insecure but still they are by themselves challenged the life to remain truthful to themselves.</p>
<p>Its only possible know them if you nurture your gift of knowing people. and its not hard, its just that you must have will to do it. Some people I know were in jail for quite sometime in life and now leading a happy family. You never got to know them by face or profession. But they fought back with life and back in it again.</p>
<p>There are persons, who were suffering so much in life that they just want to break free and go somewhere else. But its not that they do not have courage to do that. Its the opposite. They have more courage than they have, so they are fighting the situation out from the place they are, rather leaving it halfway.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are people who just do not seem to be active in any situation. But when you get into the inside of them they are more colourful and lively than you ever have thought of.</p>
<p>Knowing people is a gift to given to everyone, and if you really like to know a person then just spend sometime with them with your heart open to experience the life. Life has so much more than it just looks to our eyes.</p>
<p>Happy living</p>
