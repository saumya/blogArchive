		<p>This was just in the books until now, but I began to realise its not books only. Its the universe, and its awesome, beautiful power.  This is not about wealth but peace and happiness. Some people just do it for money in the shake of logic ( That also their own made ). I was always tried to understand them and always thought they may be have a point. But the truth is beginning to unfold in front of me. Its the power, the thought and how we use it. There is really nothing which is impossible but you must see it all the time. Day dreaming is bad, but dreaming is the first step towards doing something. So dream, whatever you think you should be doing. And the world will help you make your believe come true. And yes, intentions must be kept clear, for The God is not upto your logics and the same goes for this beautiful universe.<br />
The thoughts of yours go into the world, if they are evil, it will come back to you only. Sooner or later, the truth always wins.<br />
Never ever try to build up a relationship, any relationship with false hood. Whether its hobby, job or personal, be true to yourself and everything will fall in place. If you are thinking positive, those thoughts also will comeback to you. So keep dreaming and dream positive and infinite. The key to get there is actually within, one just need to believe.<br />
Until now, I was never able to say all this. For I was all the time have doubts for me. But at-least I can say, today I am feeling I am moving in right direction and feeling much confident about me. So sharing my thoughts, just be yourself and listen to your heart. I know, there are toxic people around, try and avoid them at all possible circumstances, for they are the evil to the core and just 5 mins of your time with them may require your 5 days to get back to your own self. They are toxic than poisonous snakes and evil creatures.  But sometimes you need to be there, for without them you might not appreciate the real good of life. So the point is, their poison destroys them, and thats bound to happen. For everything that goes out comes back. These people are never happy, always worried and insecure. They will play all the evil games, but never concentrate or loose your focus. For what they are, they will be like that and die like that. Just think, do you really want to be like that? You are born free and infinite, concentrate and move on. Life is waiting for you. Do not die every minute, but live now.<br />
And most importantly, think positive, infinite and abundance. That will comeback to you. Share love and affection and friendliness and genuine. That will comeback to you. If you think, you can make it, then go try for it. I am sure you can make it. If you fail, then you learn. Try again, if you fail again, you learn something more, try again and never give up.</p>
<p><span id="more-134"></span></p>
<p>Now, below I am putting some points about what to avoid;</p>
<p>1. You meet a known fellow suddenly in your way, he/she just listens to you and never shares anything but just excusing why you only should talk. Watch out.<br />
2. These people actually do not have anything to share genuinely, so no point wasting time there. For they have not seen the positive part of life and always dwell in evil. They pretend to be perfect by showing others faults, just because they do not have anything good to show about them, and generally these guys are hiding a lot of their past evil life. They keep on doing the fault and then it becomes their habit. And generally they dwell in a group. Fro they are fearful and insecure. STAY away from these, your precious time is required by so many beautiful people around the world.<br />
3. When someone talks all good about you, watch out. He/She is planning to put you down not take you up.<br />
4. If someone talks about you and points your faults only and never shares his/her faults, watch out. You are wasting your precious time, to make a real friend somewhere else.<br />
5. Some people just seem to be not right, listen to your heart and never doubt yourself.<br />
6. Some just talk about &#8220;should&#8221; and &#8220;should nots&#8221;, but when time comes they have reasons why they should not, keep them far far away. They are not worth your thoughts even.</p>
<p>Now, what you should try to get,</p>
<p>1. Someone unknown meet you in the streets and started talking out his/her heart. Make an effort to make a relationship.<br />
2. These people have a lot to share out of their heart and they will make you happy in your road to success in life. Cheerful people always have the same kind of attitude and if they are sad, you will know it from the image.<br />
3. If someone listens to you but tells your faults in your face, and shares the same kind of experience about his/hers , make an effort to build up the relationship. They will fix you up in life you you fall in bad shape.<br />
4. Someone accepts his/her faults and guides you not to do the same, is a relationship you should never try to break.<br />
5. Some people just seem good, listen to your heart and never doubt.<br />
6. Some people never talk about &#8220;should&#8221; and &#8220;should not&#8221;, they are the ones which know what life is and can make you motivated all the way till your success, just go for them and make all the effort to have the relationship through out your life.</p>
<p>After all its people and the relationships that matter. And if you make these people your friends, then the world is yours. If you feel bad or down, these are the guys who will come in and take you to the heights from where you can not comedown even if you try. These are the people who make every minute of your life enjoyable. And these are the people who live and encourage others to live. And for they are giving positivity to the world, that comes back to them too.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? If you want to be happy, just be happy and choose your thoughts right. For that will comeback to you to life you up. Just think what you want to be and think again, what are you doing now, whether that will take you there, if not go do something for what you have dreamt of.</p>
<p>Happy living.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Now, this a beautiful link to read more.<br />
<a href="http://worldofsu.com/philipsu/?page_id=193" rel="nofollow">Straight from heart.</a><br />
Some points taken from the link<br />
1. Listen to understand.  Speak to be understood.<br />
2. Cynics don’t get anything done.  Stop talking to people whose first response is always skeptical.  They will crush you.<br />
3. Don’t fear process.  Fear bad people dictating process.  Fear process trying to make up for bad people.<br />
4. A person is either passionate or they’re not.  People who expect their manager to make their jobs fun and interesting won’t get far.<br />
5. Smart people understand why smart people disagree.<br />
6. If it seems easy getting a bunch of great reviews, you’re probably working on the wrong team.<br />
7. Stay away from people who always have a conspiracy theory involving twisted office politics, unfulfilled Machiavellian ambitions, and unspoken agendas.<br />
8. Follow great people.  Work for great people.<br />
9. Believe in our upside.  Focus on our upside.<br />
10.Individuals are the sole cause of anything that’s ever happened.</p>
<p>Happy living</p>
