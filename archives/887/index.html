		<p><em>(language: Odiya) Khanda pralaya ru khanda pralaya parjyanta : (language : Hindi)Quayamat se Quayamat tak&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>Long long ago, there were 5 lions staying in a jungle with their families. A 5000 strong grazing animal population was part of the food chain and there was no problem for sustainability. Lions were on hunting spree when they were hungry; else they were uncles to everybody. Climate was good, no dearth of grass, enough water in the river, many fruits in the trees with lot of monkeys of course!! One day a little bird said to one uncle Lion that two strange animals are coming towards their jungle. They walk on their rear limbs, have no tails, eat anything eatable, stay inside a self-made nest, and use tools to do simple things to very complicated things. They have killed many animals on their way including an elephant by using their strange tools. They use some vocals to communicate. They preserve food for bad weather and use a rolling cart for transportations. I think they are dangerous. They are coming to stay here….for ever. The lion said, “I am the king of this jungle. Don’t you know which protein I eat? Elephant is a weak grass eating animal. Let them come I`ll pounce those walky talkies. I am very cruel when I am hungry. Everybody knows. They are not coming to my jungle but to my empty stomach”.</p>
<p>The lion waited and waited, they didn`t turn up. After few days he became very hungry. He thought those guys ran away to some other place. He saw a big fat immobilized spotted deer and thought for a great dinner instead. It was a trap. The two walky talkies killed him. Similarly they killed all the lions and started living there. With time their population grew. There were no lions, so they were on the top of the food chain. They developed medicines from herbs, used fire for cooking and many new things which surprized other animals. They overwhelmingly killed the grazing animals, even if they were not hungry! After few hundred years, grazing animals reduced to double digits. So they cleaned up jungle for agriculture, domesticated the leftover animals. After few hundred years they required more land for agriculture. A fraction of them migrated to the other side of the river and applied all the techniques they knew from this side of the river. After few hundred years, they started looking differently across the river. After few hundred years they had their own vocal communications, customs and Gods somewhat similar and somewhat different. Each side of the river started treating them as a better species. After few hundred years their number became huge. No more jungle no more grass land remained except the desert. At that point of time, they had two options either to reduce their consumption or to produce more. But they could do neither because they were habituated to live in an expensive way and their resources were limited. So they started begging, then stealing, then robbing each other. But none of them worked. So each side across the river secretly decided to attack the other side. They secretly build up unique war-fares and thought that they had an edge. One stormy night, the war started. All the weapons used. Rest is history.</p>
<p>Somebody said, “We all are born to consume resources”. Consume responsibly to live bit longer.</p>
